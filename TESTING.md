Vision: We would like to make it easier to set a meeting time and place for a disconnected group of people.
Automated Tests:
User Acceptance Tests:
	1) Once  a user has registered, he/she is able to log in and out of the website.
	2) Two separate users will enter times that overlap for a meeting, and our website will show that this is a time that they could meet.
	3) Two separate users will enter times that do no overlap for a meeting, and our website will show that they do not have a time to meet.
